FireBase PloneDemo:


- problems

  - angular-firebase is a newer version, so we have to include angularFire.js.

  - need to add ++resource++angular.js to RR profile. @cancelled (13-04-15 11:54)

  + the production of ++resource++angular.js needs a Gruntfile.js. @done (13-04-15 12:40)
  - The gruntfile should rather be in the src package, but then error.

  - cancel-submit button.
