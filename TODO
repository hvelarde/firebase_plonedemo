FireBase PloneDemo:



Problems solved initially:



Future:

  - angular-firebase is a newer version, so we have to include angularFire.js. Find the bower package so we don't need this!

  - Find also a firebase.js that currently comes from CDN

  + The gruntfile should rather be in the src package, but then error. @done (13-04-27 14:44)
